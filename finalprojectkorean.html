            <h2> Tteokbokki </h2>
            <p> Tteokbokki is one of the most famous street foods of Korea. Its depiction in Korean dramas rocketed its popularity. It is a very simple dish, which contributes to its fame. The essential components of the dish are small rice cakes in the shape of cylinders in a spicy gochujang sauce or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce) based sauce. It is often served with eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, scallions. One of the best things about tteokbokki is that it is highly customizable. Some people like adding ramen, some like using different sauces like rose sauce (a mix of gochujang and cream), jjajang sauce etc, some like adding cheese, dumplings, seafood.... the list goes on. This dish is extremely cheap, often sold at snack bars called bunsikjip and street stalls. </p>

            <h2> Ganjang Gejang </h2>
            <p> Gangjang gejang is a dish that is a bit of an acquired taste! It is prepared by marinating fresh raw crab in ganjang (soy sauce) or a spicy gochugaru (chili powder) sauce. There are many different types and they very mostly divided by crab species, region, and cooking method. The traditional preparation method is starting with separating the crab into several pieces (but it can also be carried out whole. The next step is to marinate it in the sauce for a couple of days, and then the crab is ready to be eaten. Marinated raw crabs have been a staple part of Korean culture for a long time and continues to gain popularity even to this day. </p>

There are a lot of different kinds of food and they are all becoming more and more accessible in the U.S. Korean barbecue, fried chicken, soup shops are all becoming more and more prevalent in U.S neighborhoods.

Korea also make a wide variety of delicious sweets, such as hwajeon (panfried sweet cakes) and yakgwa (honey cookies).
